## Udacity Alumni and Google Africa Scholars
This is our hub to stay connected and collaborate on projects together.</br>
If you would like to participate, follow these steps:
1. Fork this repo or edit this `README.md` directly with the connection info that you would like to share in the [Who we are section](#who-we-are). If you have completed a Nanodegree add those after your name and before your social media links.</br>Also, to keep things organized, please use the [Udacity Git Commit Message Style Guide](https://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/) for your commit messages. For instance, when updating the `README.md` use something like `docs: Add member name to README`.

2. Once you've pushed your code to Github or saved the README directly, submit a pull request to this repo with your new fork. We will merge it ASAP! (It's actually just me at the moment... help!)

3. If you would like to help maintain this group please let me know! Contact me and I'll set you up with admin privileges.

4. Start your own projects here! Let's build some amazing things! We have a large pool of people with lots of different skills. This can be a great way to get even more experience working as a team, as well as get help on ideas that you have! </br>

Open to all suggestions to improve the experience, so let's begin!
